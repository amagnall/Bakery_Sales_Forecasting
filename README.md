# Forecasting Bakery Sales 
This is my final capstone project submission for BrainStation's Data Science certificate program. The project is utilising various timeseries methods to forecast revenue of a bakery and developing a reporting dashboard summarising the best selling products and periodic trends.

Hello!

My name is Abi Magnall and this is my capstone project submission for BrainStation's Data Science certificate program titled, “Forecasting Bakery Sales".


**Purpose of this project**: 

The aim of this project is to develop Moving Averages, Linear Regression, SARIMAX and Facebook Prophet models to forecast daily, weekly and monthly revenue for the amazing Artisan Bakery, [Two Magpies Bakery](https://twomagpiesbakery.co.uk/). Market Basket Analysis is also performed to provide recommendations and provide greater clarity to the business on the most popular, complimentary and subsitute products. Through various methods of data visualization and communication the findings and actionable insights are conveyed.
