Hello!

My name is Abi Magnall and this is my capstone project submission for BrainStation's Data Science certificate program titled, “Forecasting Bakery Sales".


**Purpose of this project**: 

In this project, I develop Moving Averages, Linear Regression, SARIMAX and Facebook Prophet models to forecast daily, weekly and monthly revenue for the amazing Artisan Bakery, [Two Magpies Bakery](https://twomagpiesbakery.co.uk/). I also carry out Market Basket Analysis to provide recommendations and provide greater clarity to the business on the most popular, complimentary and subsitute products. Using various methods of data visualization and communication I convey findings and actionable insights.
